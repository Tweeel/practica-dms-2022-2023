# Search Functionality
The current implementation of the discussion application does not provide a search functionality, which limits the usability of the system. To address this limitation, we plan to introduce a search functionality that allows users to find questions, answers, and comments based on their content. This will require adding indexing to the data model, as well as implementing a search API in the backend service.

# Architecture
To implement the search functionality, we plan to use a modular architecture similar to the one used in the authentication, backend, and frontend services. This architecture consists of a data model, presentation layer, and service layer.

The data model will contain classes such as SearchIndex and SearchResult, which represent the data model for the search index and search results, respectively. The presentation layer will contain REST API implementation classes such as SearchServer and SearchSecurity, which handle API requests and security considerations. The service layer will contain classes such as SearchServices, which provide the core business logic and API implementation for the search functionality.

# Indexing
To support search, the data model will need to be modified to include indexing of the title, body, and other relevant fields of questions, answers, and comments. This can be achieved using a full-text search engine such as Elasticsearch or Solr, which can index and search large volumes of text data efficiently.

The indexing process will involve creating a new index for the discussion data, and periodically updating the index with the latest data from the database. This can be done using a background job or a scheduled task, to ensure that the search index stays up to date with the latest data.

We will use a background process, such as a cron job, to periodically update the search index with new and updated items. This process will ensure that the search index is always up-to-date and reflects the current state of the discussion application.

# Frontend
To support the search feature, the frontend will need to be updated to include a search form and a search results page. The search form will allow users to enter a keyword and submit the query, triggering a request to the search API. The search results page will display the results returned by the API, along with relevant metadata such as the creation date, owner, and number of votes.

The frontend will also need to be updated to include links to the search form and results page, allowing users to easily access the search feature from anywhere in the application.

- we will need to create a new component for the search form and results. This component can be located at dms2223frontend/dms2223frontend/presentation/search.


- The search form component will contain a simple input field and a submit button for entering the search query. When the submit button is clicked, it will make a GET request to the /search/questions or /search/answers endpoint with the query parameter, depending on the selected tab (questions or answers).


- The search results component will display the list of questions or answers returned by the API in a paginated format. It will also include a sorting dropdown to allow the user to sort the results by relevance, date, or number of votes.

# Backend

- First, we will need to create a new module in the backend service for handling the search functionality. This module can contain the following files:

  - Data model: We will need to create a new data model class to represent the search index, which will store the indexed documents and their metadata (such as the document ID, title, and content). This class should be stored in the data layer of the backend service (e.g., dms2223backend/dms2223backend/data/searchindex.py).

  - Logic layer: We will need to create a new logic layer class to handle the indexing and search operations, which will interact with the data model and the search engine API. This class should be stored in the logic layer of the backend service (e.g., dms2223backend/dms2223backend/logic/searchlogic.py).

  - Service layer: We will need to create a new service layer class to expose the search functionality to the presentation layer through a REST API. This class should call the logic layer class and handle the request/response processing. This class should be stored in the service layer of the backend service (e.g., dms2223backend/dms2223backend/service/searchservices.py).

  - Presentation layer: We will need to create a new presentation layer class to handle the REST API endpoint for search requests and responses. This class should call the service layer class and handle the request/response processing. This class should be stored in the presentation layer of the backend service (e.g., dms2223backend/dms2223backend/presentation/rest/search.py).
- Next, we will also need to modify the OpenAPI specification to include the new search API endpoints, such as /search/questions and /search/answers. These endpoints will accept a query parameter and return a list of relevant questions or answers, respectively.
# Search API
A new search API will be added to the backend service, allowing users to search for questions, answers, and comments by keyword. The API will accept a query string and return a list of results matching the query, along with relevant metadata such as the creation date, owner, and number of votes.

The search API will be implemented using the search engine chosen for indexing, and will leverage the search capabilities of the engine to provide fast and accurate results. The API will also support pagination and sorting, allowing users to browse through large result sets and customize the order in which the results are presented.

- In the backend service, create a new module (e.g. "search_api.py") to implement the search functionality.
- Define a search endpoint in the OpenAPI specification (e.g. "/search" with a GET method) that accepts a query parameter and returns a list of search results.
- Implement the search endpoint in the search_api module using the Flask route decorator. The endpoint should use the query parameter to search the search index table for matching entities and attributes, and return a list of results with the entity type, ID, and relevant attribute values.

# Pros and Cons
There are several pros and cons to consider when adding search functionality to the discussion application:

- Pros:

  - Search is a highly desired feature for many users, and adding it to the application can greatly improve the user experience.
  - Search can help users find relevant content faster, reducing the time and effort required to locate specific questions, answers, or comments.
  - Search can increase the visibility of the application, as users are more likely to share and promote content that is easily discoverable through search.

- Cons:

  - Search engines can be complex and difficult to set up and maintain, requiring specialized knowledge and resources.
  - Indexing the data model can have a performance impact on the database, especially if the data model is large and frequently updated.
# Future Work
In the future, we plan to enhance the search functionality by adding additional features such as spell-check and synonym expansion. These features will improve the accuracy of the search results and make it easier for users to find the information they are looking for. We also plan to add support for advanced search queries, such as boolean queries and proximity queries, to allow users to perform more sophisticated searches.
