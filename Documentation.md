## Introduction
This document aims to provide a detailed overview of the design decisions made for the development of the online discussion application. The application consists of three main components: an authentication service, a backend service, and a frontend service.

## High-Level Design
The high-level design of the application follows a modular architecture, with distinct data model, presentation layer, and service layer components for each service. This design decision was made to promote separation of concerns and reduce dependencies between different components.

- The authentication service is responsible for managing users, sessions, and permissions. It has a data model that includes classes such as AuthConfiguration and User, which represent the authentication configuration and user data model, respectively. The presentation layer consists of REST API implementation classes such as AuthServer and AuthSecurity, which handle API requests and security considerations. The service layer contains classes such as UserServices and RoleServices, which provide the core business logic and API implementation for user and role management.

- The backend service is responsible for the core business logic and API implementation for managing discussions, answers, and comments. It follows a similar modular architecture, with a data model that includes classes such as Sentiment and ReportStatus, representing the sentiment data model and report status data model, respectively. The service layer contains classes such as DiscussionsServices, AnswersServices, and CommentsServices, which provide the core business logic and API implementation for managing these entities.

- The frontend service provides a web interface for users to interact with the system and perform various operations. It follows a modular architecture, with a presentation layer that consists of HTML templates and JavaScript code for handling user interactions and making API calls to the backend service.

## Low-Level Design
The project is implemented using the Flask web framework and the SQLAlchemy library for data persistence. The presentation layers of the authentication and backend services consist of REST API endpoints implemented using Flask routes and decorated with OpenAPI-compliant decorators, which provide documentation and validation of the API parameters and responses.

The frontend presentation layer consists of HTML templates and JavaScript code using the Vue.js framework. The HTML templates are generated using Jinja2 templates, and the JavaScript code makes API calls to the backend service using the axios library.

The data model layers of the authentication and backend services use SQLAlchemy models to define the schema of the data stored in the database. The service layers use these models to perform CRUD operations on the data.

## Design Decisions
The project follows the SOLID principles of object-oriented design in order to maintain a high level of code quality and maintainability.

- The Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) is upheld by dividing the project into distinct components, such as the authentication service, backend service, and frontend service, each with their own specific responsibilities.
- The Open-Closed Principle (OCP) is upheld by using a modular architecture, allowing new functionality to be added through the implementation of new modules or by extending existing ones, without requiring modifications to existing code.
- The Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) is upheld by using inheritance and interface-based design, ensuring that derived classes can be used interchangeably with their base classes.
T- he Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) is upheld by designing small, specific interfaces that are only implemented by the classes that require them, rather than large, general interfaces that may have unnecessary methods for some classes.
- The Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) is upheld by depending on abstractions rather than concrete implementations, allowing for flexibility in the choice of implementations and facilitating the substitution of one implementation for another.

Some additional design decisions that were made include:

- Using the Flask web framework for the presentation layer and the SQLAlchemy library for data persistence in the backend service, in order to facilitate the development of the REST API and the interaction with the database.
- Using the OpenAPI specification to define the API contract and generate API documentation, in order to improve the understandability and maintainability of the API.
- Organizing the codebase into a four-tier architecture, with distinct data model, logic, service, and presentation layers, in order to separate the different concerns and reduce dependencies between components.

Some potential pros and cons of these design decisions include:

- Using the Flask web framework and SQLAlchemy library may provide a convenient and lightweight solution for the specific requirements of the project, but may not be as scalable or performant as other more heavyweight options.
- Using the OpenAPI specification may improve the documentation and testing of the API, but may require additional effort to maintain the specification and generate the documentation.
- Organizing the codebase into a four-tier architecture may improve the maintainability and extensibility of the codebase, but may require more effort to set up and may result in a more complex codebase.

## Pros and Cons of Design Decisions
The modular architecture of the application has the following advantages:

- Separation of concerns: Each layer of the application has a specific responsibility, which promotes a clear separation of concerns and reduces dependencies between different components.

- Reusability: The modules of the application can be easily reused in other projects, as they are independent of the rest of the application.

- Maintainability: The modular architecture makes it easier to maintain the application, as changes to one module do not affect the rest of the application.

However, the modular architecture also has some disadvantages:

- Complexity: The modular architecture adds an extra layer of complexity to the application, as there are more components to manage and coordinate.

- Development time: Developing a modular architecture may take longer, as there are more components to implement and test.

- Overall, the modular architecture was chosen for this application due to the benefits it provides in terms of separation of concerns, reusability, and maintainability.
