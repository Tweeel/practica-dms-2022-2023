## High-Level Design: 

The project is a discussion application that consists of three main components: an authentication service, a backend service, and a frontend service. The authentication service handles user management, session management, and permission management, while the backend service contains the core business logic and API implementation for managing discussions, answers, and comments. The frontend service provides a web interface for users to interact with the system and perform various operations.

- The authentication service: The authentication service is implemented using a modular architecture, with distinct data model, presentation layer, and service layer components. The data model contains classes such as AuthConfiguration and User, which represent the authentication configuration and user data model, respectively. The presentation layer contains REST API implementation classes such as AuthServer and AuthSecurity, which handle API requests and security considerations. The service layer contains classes such as UserServices and RoleServices, which provide the core business logic and API implementation for user and role management.

- The backend service: The backend service is also implemented using a modular architecture, with a data model, presentation layer, and service layer. The data model contains classes such as Sentiment and ReportStatus, which represent the sentiment data model and report status data model, respectively. The presentation layer is not specified in the provided code. The service layer contains classes such as DiscussionsServices, AnswersServices, and CommentsServices, which provide the core business logic and API implementation for managing discussions, answers, and comments.

- The frontend service: The frontend service is implemented using a modular architecture, with a presentation layer. The presentation layer is not specified in the provided code.

## Low-Level Design: 

The project implemented using the Flask web framework and the SQLAlchemy library for data persistence. The presentation layer consists of REST API endpoints implemented using Flask routes and decorated with OpenAPI-compliant decorators, which provide documentation and validation of the API parameters and responses.
